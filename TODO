- media vs. root vs. custom
- pupu-gen
- url prefix as MEDIA_PREFIX in Django
- Rakefile -> Thorfile & without any merb-related stuff
- maybe js.erb which generates .js after installation (image paths problem)
- how to handle metadata? Generate metadata.yml from config.rb (dependencies) or generate it through merb-gen and write it by hand?
- what about ruby helpers such as flash :notice, :error for flash <divs
- what about versions? See RubyGems.
- move bin/pupu into thorfile
- all errors should ends with Error (as StandardError)
- custom messages on errors
- Rakefile is template, not just plain file (generator)
- Create the generator rake tasks
- blueprint pupu
- install dependencies if any
- merb-gen pupu my-pupu --js=[jquery,prototype,plain]
- add array with loaded plugins, do not load plugin which is already loaded
- pupu view helper should works with dependencies (pupu :autocompleter should add mootools as well)
- [BUG] initializers are copyied into bad directory
