metadata vzdycky, dat je do ignore
pupu has a license, but the stuff we want to put into pupu probably has also a license (MooTools is under MIT etc)
- media support (.swf): media helper
- adapters for Rango, Merb, Rails (helpers registration)
- media vs. root vs. custom
- how to handle metadata? Generate metadata.yml from config.rb (dependencies) or generate it through merb-gen and write it by hand?
- what about ruby helpers such as flash :notice, :error for flash <divs
- custom messages on errors
- install dependencies if any
- add array with loaded plugins, do not load plugin which is already loaded
- pupu view helper should works with dependencies (pupu :autocompleter should add mootools as well)
