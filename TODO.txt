=== Version 0.1 ===
- adapters for Rango, Merb, Rails (tasks, helpers)
- media vs. root vs. custom
- url prefix as Pupu.media_prefix in Django
- maybe js.erb which generates .js after installation (image paths problem)
- how to handle metadata? Generate metadata.yml from config.rb (dependencies) or generate it through merb-gen and write it by hand?
- what about ruby helpers such as flash :notice, :error for flash <divs
- custom messages on errors
- Rakefile is a template, not just plain file (generator)
- blueprint pupu
- install dependencies if any
- add array with loaded plugins, do not load plugin which is already loaded
- pupu view helper should works with dependencies (pupu :autocompleter should add mootools as well)
